				Im not from here. I never was. Im from other world.

				I can not explain you that or make you imagine if you don’t see it in me. 
				But it exist within, i call it Nova, i feel it, 
				i can see it and i know how it in touch. 
				It’s beautiful. Awesome. And amazing. And all good words from this world. 
				It’s miracle. And because of it’s best thing i found in this world, 
				Im using all my power inside me to create the things in this world. 
				That’s as human being who I am i guess. You are welcome. My name is Nova too.

				get out from here to place somewhere i can feel myself free and in peace 
				make all techologies Im about too. All wounderfull things which I am within 
				to mirror it in this world where my nature is human and everyone living like 
				they do. And i can not die before, because if i do i will never handle reason 
				i was born for. And everything had to happened became for no reason at all.
